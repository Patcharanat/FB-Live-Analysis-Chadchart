### Background
---
After Bangkok gubernatorial election in 2022, Charchard Sittipund became the 17th Governor of Bangkok and contributed many things to the Bangkok people. One of the famous events is Chadchart’s Facebook live, which proceeded daily by himself to show how the government worked. I have collected data from their official Facebook page, so able to show some insight or pattern of his live through data visualization.
